# spriter

spriter generates sprites from a probability mask that defines where the
sprite's body and border might be.

# Uses

Rogue-likes.

Default avatars.

Visual represenation of hashes.

Random silliness.

# Credits

The probability mask concept is based on Dave Bollinger's 'pixelrobots' and
'pixelspaceships' algorithm.
